The website itself is also open source, and [available here][1].

## Un-Features
* No sign up
* No requests to rate the app
* No trial periods
* No paid upgrades

## Is this a joke?
Yeah, pretty much.

I was curious about how much effort it would take to wrap a website in an app.

Turns out it's pretty easy.
